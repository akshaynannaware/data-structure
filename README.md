# data-structure
All the programs of Data Sturcture in C language...

compile and run commands - gcc program_name.c
To run - ./a.out
                            
                            the data stucture use is singly linked list 
                            
                            
1. Insert input as prefix or postfix expression and convert it into infix expression. (Give
explanation about either using queue or stack data structure).

2. Evaluate an infix string using 2 stacks without converting to postfix to infix, directly
evaluate postfix string.

3. Implement CPU scheduling. (Give explanation that which data structure will suitable
for it preferably use linked list).

4. Write a program to find whether given linked list is palindrome or not.

5. Implement elevator using linked list (You are free to do all types of assumptions)
